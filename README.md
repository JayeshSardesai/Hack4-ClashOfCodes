# Hack4-ClashOfCodes

## Overview

The problem is the difficulty in connecting skilled service providers (like engineers, plumbers, tutors, etc.) with individuals and businesses who need their services. This often leads to inefficiencies, inconvenience, and a lack of transparency in the service industry. Small-scale service providers, such as home cleaners, repair technicians, and other local service professionals, often face challenges in finding and securing consistent work.
